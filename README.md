# car-prices-prediction-model
It is a car price prediction model based on the data set provided by Kaggle.
The data set provided by Kaggle contains certain features/columns. At first some data cleaning procedure is done in order to improve the data set.
Then the correlation between all the features is plotted using pairplot and heatmap from seaborn liabrary and matplotlib.Then hyperparameter tuning is done 
using random forest regressor CV. Then at last there is linear regression that helps the price prediction.
